##Cloud monitoring and alerts refer to the tools and processes used to track the performance, health, and security of cloud infrastructure and services. Cloud monitoring involves continuously observing metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, network traffic, and application performance. These metrics help ensure that cloud resources are functioning optimally and can identify issues such as downtime or resource bottlenecks. Alerts are set up to notify administrators or users when certain thresholds or conditions are met, such as a sudden spike in traffic or a service failure
